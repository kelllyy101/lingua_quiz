### Fixed Bugs

- During the development of my JavaScript quiz, I encountered and addressed several bugs to improve the functionality and user experience. The following are the key issues I fixed:

1. Changing colors for the right and wrong answer:
One of the bugs I encountered was the incorrect display of colors for right and wrong answers. To fix this, I modified the JavaScript code responsible for highlighting the answers. Now, when a user selects the correct answer, it is appropriately marked green, indicating their success. Similarly, when a user selects the wrong answer, it is visually differentiated with red, providing immediate feedback.

2. Negative numbers in the timer:
Another bug that I resolved was the timer showing negative numbers. Initially, the timer would continue counting down beyond zero and display negative values. To rectify this issue, I added a condition in the JavaScript code that ensures the timer stops at zero, preventing negative numbers from being displayed. This improvement ensures accurate and positive time representation for users taking the quiz and the timer is reset to 10 every time the user moves on to a new question.

3. Pause on the first question:
Initially, the quiz would not advance to the next question even if the user answers the first question. To enhance the user experience, I implemented a pause functionality on the first question. Now, when the quiz is loaded, it pauses on the first question, allowing users to carefully read and consider their response before proceeding to the next question. This change ensures users have adequate time to interact with each question and provides a more intuitive quiz experience.

### Unfixed Bugs

- When user does not answer a question, they have to restart the whole level of the quiz, losing their accumulated scores, although they will not visually return to zero. The scores will be recounted from zero as soon as the user chooses an answer, and will continue until 10.

### Other Known Bugs

- No other known bugs.
