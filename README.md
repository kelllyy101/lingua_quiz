HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) will be used to structure the content of the quiz, including headings, paragraphs, forms, and other elements necessary for creating the user interface.

CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be utilized for styling the quiz, ensuring visually appealing and consistent presentation across different devices. CSS will handle layout, colors, typography, and other visual aspects of the quiz.

JavaScript: JavaScript will be the primary programming language used for the quiz's interactivity and functionality. It will handle user input, validate answers, calculate scores, and dynamically update the quiz based on user actions.
